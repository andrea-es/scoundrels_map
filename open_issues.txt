**Chrome - handle cookies consent popup**
works in Italian but not in other languages, fimd a more solid alternative

**Geolocation for coordinates of current position**
right now i'm blocked by the cookie consent button in any site that i can scrape from and i have to give coordinates manually. if it's on a device, can get data from gps.

**Getting origin and destination from Waze**
for now, i have to manually give origin and destination into the browser for this (and the markers scraping) to works

**Getting coordinates of markers**
they are a bit off. not a lot, but enough to give wrong directions

**Openrouteservice api"
terms and conditions (and duration of the key) unclear
